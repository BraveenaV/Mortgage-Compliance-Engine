# Mortgage-Compliance-Engine
A C++ logic engine to automate TRID compliance checks, leveraging 7 years of mortgage industry experience.

# TRID Compliance Logic Engine (C++)

## Project Overview
This project translates my 7 years of mortgage domain expertise into a technical solution. It automates the validation of **Closing Disclosures (CD)** against **Loan Estimates (LE)** to ensure strict adherence to federal TRID regulations.

## Features
- **OOPS Architecture:** Utilizes Inheritance and Polymorphism to manage FHA, VA, and Conventional loan rules.
- **Automated Unit Testing:** Includes built-in test cases to ensure "testable and efficient code" as required for mission-critical systems.
- **Accuracy:** Automates 0% and 10% tolerance bucket calculations to minimize post-closing defects.

## Technical Skills Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), Unit Testing, Logic Design.
